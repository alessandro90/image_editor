# Pycture

Pycture is a simple python 3 image manipulation application. It allows to modify several properties of an image, from color-balance to brightness; apply pre-defined filters and to make all white pixels transparent.
Currently, supported image formats are jpeg, png and tiff. It can also be used to convert an image between such types of formats.
To start the application from command line type `python pycture.py`.
